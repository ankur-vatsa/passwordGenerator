# passwordGenerator
Created a web app that generates secure passwords based on user-defined criteria (length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols). It evaluates password strength in real-time and shows the last three generated passwords with timestamps. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app emphasizes usability and security.
